      <h2>Welcome to my Blog!</h2>
      <p>19 December 2019</p>
	<br><br>
      <p>Welcome to my new blog, and also my new website, so please feel free to have a look around and tell me what you think! 
	<br><br>
	This blog will allow me to write about what I am doing throughout my life, including academically and leisure activities. I will post semi-regular blogs in order to track everything I am doing, from flying my drone to studying for university. I am currently in third year (out of four) of my BSc (Hons) Computer Science at University, so I will be sure to keep you updated on how that is going for me. 
	<br><br>
	Regarding my drone, I am currently becoming increasingly interested in drone photography, and I am fascinated with attempting to get the perfect drone shot. I have been playing around with the various settings available to me, but there is still so much for me to learn! If you have any advice for me, then please get in contact with me using the form on this website. It really is greatly appreciated and I will try to respond to you as soon as I can. 
	<br><br>
	I also want to get in to cooking properly from scratch, and learn to get away from the convenience of takeaways and ready meals, which as a student is quite a difficult thing to do! Iâ€™ve bought a few cookbooks which should allow me to start off with some relatively easy recipes, but any advice which you have will be much appreciated by me. I will be sure to show photographs of my dishes, and share any recipes which I like using. 
	<br><br>
	Just a short introduction post to start off with, but hopefully I can continue this for a long time and achieve everything I could possibly dream of in my life. </p>
