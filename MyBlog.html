    <h2>My Analysis Services - Energy</h2>

	<p>
I am a BSc (Hons) Computer Science graduate who is currently working as a data analyst in the energy sector. I joined the 
sector in May 2021 and have been analysing large amounts of electricity data, from a variety of different energy assets, 
through a turbulent time of energy prices and the industry. Having just come out of record lows from the coronavirus 
pandemic, prices increased to record highs due to the global gas price and Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the UK 
government needing to step in to shield domestic and non-domestic price surges. 

<br><br>

I am passionate about data and enjoy analysing any information I can, in the hope of gathering useful insights which can 
be presented, to allow for useful and beneficial decisions to be made based on the analysis. 

<br><br>

I now wish to use the skills and knowledge I have gathered throughout my educational and work experience to help those 
to invest in renewable energy systems for their household, to protect the environment and provide savings from the 
electricity bills. I can also help with existing solar and battery storage systems within your home, analyse the data 
currently being produced by your systems, and make sure that you are benefitting from the highest levels of revenue you can.

<br><br>

I will never take any commission from any contracts that you agree as part of my analysis. All of my fee structures are 
simple and easy to understand before I carry out any work for you, so you can be sure of the cost of my analysis before I 
start the work. I operate on a fixed fee basis, so you know exactly how much this will cost you before you make the 
decision. I invoice all of my work upon completion. 

<br><br>

For my analysis, I will require some simple details about your system, such as capacity and the systems installed. I will 
also require a minimum of 12 months (or less, if your system is less than 12 months old) of half-hourly data from your 
system to allow me to carry out my analysis. I can advise how this can be downloaded, or I can be added as an authorised 
party to your account which will allow me to download all of the data myself. I may also require a Single Line Diagram of 
your Battery Storage system, if applicable. 

<br><br>

I can also work on an Hourly Rates basis, for any larger analysis projects that you wish to be completed. 

<br><br>

For a monthly or annual Fixed Fee, I also operate a Bill Verification process for all of your import and export 
statements. I will add myself as an authorised party to your account, download all statements and backing data, and 
check that all information is correct. I will then send you all checked statements to you, presented to you in an 
organised manner and summarised in an easy-to-understand spreadsheet. 
	

<br><br><br><br>

------------------------------

<br><br><br><br>

The FiT scheme was paid on all energy you generated, with a separate tariff available in addition to this for all 
energy you exported to the national grid. Whilst you will almost never want to give up your generation tariff, you 
could opt in and out of the export side of the tariff as many times as you wish (minimum 12 months commitment each time. 

<br><br>

When you opt out of the FiT tariff, you cannot rejoin it for a minimum of 12 months, and can often be treated as a 
‘floor’ price if wholesale prices dramatically increased such as during the coronavirus pandemic. 

<br><br>

The FiT scheme was replaced by the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG), which all large electricity suppliers must offer. Small 
suppliers can also offer this on a voluntary basis. SEG rates are chosen by the supplier on a commercial basis, so long 
as the rate is above zero. You can choose which SEG supplier you wish to go with The main difference is that there is no 
longer a generation tariff available for new systems. You are now only paid on any electricity you export to the grid. 

<br><br>

The scheme is only available to the following technologies up to five Megawatts (5 MW): Solar Photovoltaic (PV), Wind, 
Micro Combined Heat and Power (CHP), Hydro, and Anaerobic Digestion. Most households will likely be looking at Solar 
Panels on their roof, potentially partnered with Battery Storage to maximise potential returns. 

<br><br>

Although all large electricity suppliers will offer a SEG tariff available to all, many also offer more lucrative rates 
to those customers who agree to sign their import electricity contract with them too. It can be a confusing mess of what 
tariffs are best situated to your lifestyle and energy use situation, and this is where I can help you. I will go through
your energy data and analyse your time of use, suggesting tariffs which may be better suited to yourselves, and making 
any recommendations which I feel will benefit your energy consumption and bills. 


<br><br><br><br>

------------------------------

<br><br><br><br>

My fees are simple and easy to understand, and you will always know what my analysis services will cost you before I
start my work. I cater for data analysis in all homes and with a wide variety of different energy and metering systems, 
so please contact me to discuss further. You can let me know what you need, I will let you my thoughts about what we should
do, and we can arrange fair fee that is suitable for both of us. 

As a general rule of thumb, my fixed fees for my energy analysis services as as follows. 

<br><br>

Domestic Non Half Hourly Meter (Non - Smart or Dumb Meter): £35.00 - suitable for those looking at smart metering to see if they can save money. 
Domestic Half Hourly Meter (Smart Meter): £55.00 - analysing your energy backing data, checking time-of -use, suggesting tariffs and potential energy systems to install. 
Domestic Half Hourly Meter with System Attached (Solar, Battery, Electric Vehicle Charging): £75.00 

<br><br>

All of my fees are fixed and will be invoiced upon completion. I will take no commission from any contracts that you sign with suppliers. 

<br><br> 

I can carry out a wide range of energy analysis services for you which may not be described in the examples here. Please 
let me know and we can discuss, agree a fee, and I can get to work analysing your energy needs!
