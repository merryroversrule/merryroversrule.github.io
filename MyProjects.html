<p>
On this page you will find all of the projects I have completed, and this page will be continually
updated each time I complete something else.

Please contact me for specific licenses and I'll be glad to advise.

Formula 1 is a data-driven sport, with large amounts of data being gathered and analysed to give competitors the edge over one another to achieve the
goal of winning World Championships. This project will explore graph databases and visualisation techniques to model the dataset in Neo4j, and explore the
visualisations provided to analyse the dataset and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using graph databases for analysis of the dataset.

    Edinburgh Airport Flight Information for August 2017

<br>
Using some <a href="files/EdinburghAirportFllghtInformation-RawData.xlsx">raw data</a> containing information about flights which arrived or departed from
Edinburgh Airport, I created a report analysing this data to produce a monthly summary of passenger flight information illustrating trends on passenger distributions,
aircraft delays, seat load factors, pier service levels, and passenger distributions across departure gates and baggage reclaim belts. This data analysis has been
carried out using Microsoft Excel, with the report being produced with Microsoft Word. Furthermore, I have created a visualisation of this raw data in PowerBI
to provide another method of representing this data.

If you have any other data analysis which I could carry out, or you want to give me feedback on any of my work, then please contact me and I would love to discuss!

------------------------------

<br><br><br><br>

I am a BSc (Hons) Computer Science graduate who is currently working as a data analyst in the energy sector. I joined the 
sector in May 2021 and have been analysing large amounts of electricity data, from a variety of different energy assets, 
through a turbulent time of energy prices and the industry. Having just come out of record lows from the coronavirus 
pandemic, prices increased to record highs due to the global gas price and Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the UK 
government needing to step in to shield domestic and non-domestic price surges. 

<br><br>

I am passionate about data and enjoy analysing any information I can, in the hope of gathering useful insights which can 
be presented, to allow for useful and beneficial decisions to be made based on the analysis. 

<br><br>

I now wish to use the skills and knowledge I have gathered throughout my educational and work experience to help those to 
invest in renewable energy systems for their household, to protect the environment and provide savings from the 
electricity bills. I can also help with existing solar and battery storage systems within your home, analyse the data 
currently being produced by your systems, and make sure that you are benefitting from the highest levels of revenue you can.

<br><br>

I will never take any commission from any contracts that you agree as part of my analysis. All of my fee structures are 
simple and easy to understand before I carry out any work for you, so you can be sure of the cost of my analysis before I 
start the work. I operate on a fixed fee basis, so you know exactly how much this will cost you before you make the 
decision. I invoice all of my work upon completion. 

<br><br>

For my analysis, I will require some simple details about your system, such as capacity and the systems installed. I will 
also require a minimum of 12 months (or less, if your system is less than 12 months old) of half-hourly data from your 
system to allow me to carry out my analysis. I can advise how this can be downloaded, or I can be added as an authorised 
party to your account which will allow me to download all of the data myself. I may also require a Single Line Diagram 
of your Battery Storage system, if applicable.

I am currently in the process of creating comprehensive notes for all SQA subjects at National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher level. The plan is for all subjects
to be included eventually, both those I have completed myself as well as the subjects I have not yet achieved, as I love learning new things! Each subject will contain
comprehensive course notes and past paper questions.

<br><br>

I want learning and study resources to be available to as many people as possible, which is why they are free for anyone to use. However, any contributions to my hosting fees are
much appreciated. All donations are spent on creating more study resources and ensuring as many people as possible can benefit.
