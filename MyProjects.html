    My Dissertation
</a>
<br>
My Dissertation from my final year of my BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree which I completed at Heriot Watt University. 
<br><br>
Abstract - 
<br>	
Formula 1 is a data-driven sport, with large amounts of data being gathered and analysed to give competitors the edge over one another to achieve the 
goal of winning World Championships. This project will explore graph databases and visualisation techniques to model the dataset in Neo4j, and explore the 
visualisations provided to analyse the dataset and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using graph databases for analysis of the dataset.
